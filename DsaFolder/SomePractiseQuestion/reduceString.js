/*
You have develop a application that basically reduce the length of string .

the logic behind that is you can remove zero or more than zero consecutive characters from string and replace with the

no of characters removed .

You are testing your application you have two strings str1 and str2 . check whether str2 is valid reduced string of str1 if yes return True else return False.



Example 1:

Input:

 str1 = "SHARPENER"

str2 = "S3P3R"

Output: True

Explanation: We can clearly see that T is a valid compressed string for S.



Example 2:

Input:

str1 = "DFS"

str2 = "D1D"

Output : 0

Explanation: T is not a valid compressed string.



Constraints:

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^6

1 ≤ |T| ≤ 10^6

All characters are either capital or numeric.
*/

// from the constrain we can say that we have to solve the above problem in 0(n) time complexicity;
