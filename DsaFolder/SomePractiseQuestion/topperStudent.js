/*
You have given array of marks of students .

A topper is a student whose marks are greater than marks of all the students present at its right .

The Student at last of array will always a topper , You have to return Marks of all the toppers in array .



Example 1:

Input:

 n = 6

A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}

Output: 17 5 2 

Explanation: The first Topper's marks are 17 as it is greater than all the elements to its right. Similarly, the next topper is 5. The right most element is always a topper so it is also included.



Example 2:

Input: 

n = 5

A[] = {1,2,3,4,0}

Output: 4 0



Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^7

0 <= Ai <= 10^7

*/

// from the constrain of n we have to solve the problem in 0(n) time
